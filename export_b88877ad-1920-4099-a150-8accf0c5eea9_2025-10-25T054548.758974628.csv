The model examines dependencies between five input indicators—institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication—and two output indicators—knowledge and technology outputs, and creative outputs. The analysis identifies business sophistication as the most influential factor, directly driving both types of innovation outputs. Market sophistication and human capital and research also emerge as key contributors, highlighting the importance of competitive markets, skilled talent, and research capacity. By capturing the probabilistic interdependencies among innovation inputs and outputs, this study offers a novel, network-based perspective that advances understanding of innovation dynamics. The findings provide evidence-based insights for policymakers to target resource allocation and policy design, and for businesses to identify strategic priorities that enhance competitiveness and foster sustainable, innovation-led growth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bayesian belief network; Business sophistication; Global Innovation Index; Human capital; Innovation","","","","The work in this paper was supported, in part, by the Faculty Research Grant (FRG25-C-B68) and the Open Access Program\u00A0from the American University of Sharjah.

Our findings indicate that innovation is associated with nuanced relationships with bank performance indicators, and innovation potentially increases (decreases) performance via the return on asssets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), Tobin's Q, and stock market returns. Our analysis demonstrates that uncertainty plays a complex role in influencing bank performance. It has a negative impact on economic policy uncertainty (EPU) and the World Uncertainty Index (WUI), but a positive impact on geopolitical risk (GPR). However, we observe an interaction effect, which suggests that uncertainty has the potential to either diminish or amplify the impact of innovation on bank performance metrics. Specifically, the relationship between innovation and bank performance, whether negative or positive, is influenced by the presence of uncertainty. This nuanced interaction highlights the dynamic nature of the relationship between innovation and bank performance, as it is contingent on the prevailing level of uncertainty. Therefore, fostering an environment in the banking sector that is conducive to growth and stability is crucial for enhancing innovation, minimizing uncertainty, and improving bank performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global innovation index; Mena; Performance; Uncertainty","","","","","Hakimi, Abdelaziz, The Interactional Relationships Between Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk and Bank Profitability in MENA Region, Global Business Review, 23, 3, pp. 561-583, (2022); Adelopo, Ismail, Determinants of bank profitability before, during, and after the financial crisis, International Journal of Managerial Finance, 14, 4, pp. 378-398, (2018); Adra, Samer, Geopolitical risk and corporate payout policy, International Review of Financial Analysis, 87, (2023); undefined, (2018); Akinci, Özge, How effective are macroprudential policies?

However, empirical evidence on the impact of innovation on environmental sustainability is scarce. The present study tries to fill this gap by employing a panel data set of 229 countries (2013−2020) and using a novel database of countries' innovation scores (the Global Innovation Index). The results are manifold: firstly, we find a robust negative relationship between a country's innovativeness and its CO2 per capita. Secondly, the negative relationship persists when we control for level of development and other drivers of CO2 emissions. Thirdly, the effect holds when we use other measures of environmental sustainability. Fourthly, the empirical results show that while innovation can help to reduce the environmental footprint, being innovative is not enough to achieve a sustainable level of emissions. This explains why the focus is shifting towards green or eco-innovations as a way to solve environmental problems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CO2 Emissions; Ecological Footprint; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Global Innovation Index; Sustainability","carbon emission; ecological footprint; economic growth; environmental politics; global perspective; innovation; Kuznets curve; panel data; sustainability","","","","Acemoglu, Daron, The environment and directed technical change, American Economic Review, 102, 1, pp. 131-166, (2012); Adetutu, Morakinyo O., The effects of efficiency and TFP growth on pollution in Europe: a multistage spatial analysis, Journal of Productivity Analysis, 43, 3, pp. 307-326, (2015); Alcácer, Juan, Applicant and examiner citations in U.S. patents: An overview and analysis, Research Policy, 38, 2, pp. 415-427, (2009); Álvarez, Agustín Pablo, Energy Innovations-GHG Emissions Nexus: Fresh Empirical Evidence from OECD Countries, Energy Policy, 101, pp. 90-100, (2017); Balsalobre-Lorente, Daniel, The carbon dioxide neutralizing effect of energy innovation on international tourism in EU-5 countries under the prism of the EKC hypothesis, Journal of Environmental Management, 298, (2021); Bogliacino, Francesco, Innovation and employment: A firm level analysis with European R&D Scoreboard data, EconomiA, 15, 2, pp. 141-154, (2014); Boldrín, Michele, The case against patents, Journal of Economic Perspectives, 27, 1, pp. 3-22, (2013); Cainelli, Giulio, Environmental innovations in services: Manufacturing-services integration and policy transmissions, Research Policy, 42, 9, pp. 1595-1604, (2013); Carrión-Flores, Carmen E., Environmental innovation and environmental performance, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 59, 1, pp. 27-42, (2010); World Inequality Report 2022, (2022)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09218009","","ECECE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009437057"

Inclusive innovation seeks to democratize access to technology and opportunities, while green growth promotes economic progress with reduced environmental impact. This study explores the relationship between inclusive innovation and green growth by examining how the Global Innovation Index (an indicator for inclusive innovation) affects the carbon intensity of GDP (a measure of green growth). Using an endogenous growth model across 35 Advanced Economies, we employ panel techniques for long-term, quantile, and causality analyses. Our findings reveal that inclusive innovation fosters green growth in the long term, effectively reduces emissions in countries with high innovation adoption, and exhibits robust bidirectional causality between the two.

As a result, the state of digitalisation of the defence economy of Ukraine is characterised through qualitative and quantitative indicators, allowing for the substantial efforts of the state to implement digitalisation and ensure cybersecurity to be noted. It is established that the country’s cybersecurity level was lower than the global average, and the spending on digitalisation in the defence sector was only 0.16% of the total cost of the main areas. In the paper, it is noted that improving the level of cybersecurity in the context of the rapid introduction of digitalisation is a priority for ensuring defence capability because digitalisation creates new challenges for cybersecurity. This is confirmed by regression analysis, which identified a statistically substantial and negative impact of digitalisation and the level of human development on cybersecurity. In addition, the aspects of countries’ defence capabilities that are most affected by the level of cybersecurity are determined using regression analysis. It is discovered that the increase in the cybersecurity indicator per unit caused an increase in military strength by 0.354. Therefore, the impact of cybersecurity on defence economy can be considered substantial. Based on the results of the study, recommendations are formed for Ukraine on digitalisation of the defence economy and improving the level of cybersecurity.

A dataset of 758 technology crowdfunding campaigns from Kickstarter was analysed. Our findings reveal that higher home-country technological legitimacy (measured by the Global Innovation Index) affects crowdfunding performance (measured by the ratio of funds raised to the pledged goal). We also find that positive psychological capital language (optimism, insistence, and tenacity) plays a crucial moderating role in strengthening this relationship. This study extends the legitimacy theory by demonstrating that country-level technological legitimacy is an external signal that shapes backer perceptions and funding decisions.

While various factors influence green growth, two important factors that have been overlooked in research are the global innovation index and the fragile states index. This study employs novel methods, such as necessary condition analysis (NCA) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), to analyze green growth across 90 countries in 2019, surpassing traditional regression techniques. The NCA model identifies essential variables for green growth, revealing that global innovation, institutional quality, human development, and globalization are crucial conditions. Conversely, the fsQCA model offers intricate solutions by combining key variables for green growth. It presents five solutions for achieving high green growth, each tailored to specific groups of countries. For instance, Solution 1, with a consistency of 0.96%, suggests that increased consumption of renewable energy, greater trade openness, and reduced fragility in states lead to higher green growth in countries like Denmark and Austria. Thus, policymakers can foster both economic growth and environmental improvement by promoting renewable energy adoption, enhancing global trade management, and strengthening institutional quality and political stability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fragile states; fsQCA model; global innovation index; green growth; NCA model","alternative energy; economic growth; environmental modeling; environmental quality; global trade; globalization; innovation; policy making; research work; Austria; Denmark","","","This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China [grant number 22CJY060], and supported by the Hainan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number: 723QN225].

To do this, the article proposes an agent-based model called the Innovameter. The dependent variable is the Global Innovation Index. The paper focuses on data analysis through correlation analysis and multiple hierarchical regressions to determine the contribution of specific variables related to the pillars of the Global Innovation Index and indicators of the Human Development Index. After analyzing the data, an agent-based model was built to parameterize these main variables by defining two levels of abstraction: at the global level, there is the country, where birth rates, life expectancy, ICT use, and research and development are defined. At the local level, we define the individuals who have an age, years of schooling, and income. A series of experiments were conducted by selecting data from 30 countries. From the results of the experiments, a nonparametric correlation analysis was performed, and correlation indices were obtained indicating a relationship between the predicted outcomes and the outcomes in the global index. The proposed model aims to provide suggestions on how the different variables can become the norm in most of the countries studied. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","agent based model; Article; birth rate; business sophistication; commercial phenomena; computer simulation; Europe; global innovation index; human; human development index; infrastructure; life expectancy; market sophistication; perception; statistical concepts; Western Hemisphere","","","The authors would like to express their gratitude to the educational institutions to which they belong: Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Fundaci\u00F3n Universitaria Konrad Lorenz and Fundaci\u00F3n Universitaria Los Libertadores for their support during the investigative process.","Rev Qual, (2021); Resumen Indice Mundial De Innovacion 2022, (2022); Bate, Adisu Fanta, The determinants of innovation performance: an income-based cross-country comparative analysis using the Global Innovation Index (GII), Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 12, 1, (2023); Malik, Sakshi, Macroeconomic Determinants of Innovation: Evidence from Asian Countries, Global Business Review, 24, 1, pp. 137-151, (2023); Ulku, Hulya, R&D, innovation, and growth: Evidence from four manufacturing sectors in OECD countries, Oxford Economic Papers, 59, 3, pp. 513-535, (2007); Crespi, Gustavo Atilio, Innovation and Productivity: Evidence from Six Latin American Countries, World Development, 40, 2, pp. 273-290, (2012); World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, (2019); Investigacion E Innovacion En Ingenierias, (2015); Papers Revista De Sociologia, (2006); Innovative Approaches in Agent Based Modelling and Business Intelligence, (2018)","","Public Library of Science","","","","","","19326203","","POLNC","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214350723"

Rooted in innovation dynamics, this study investigates the extent to which the pillars of national innovation systems (NIS), namely institutions, human capital and research, infrastructure, market sophistication, and business sophistication, influence the level of economic complexity across countries. Using data from 112 countries in 2020, drawn from the Global Innovation Index (GII) and the Economic Complexity Index (ECI), multiple linear regression models were estimated to assess the direct and interaction effects of these pillars. The results reveal that infrastructure and business sophistication have a significant and positive influence on economic complexity, while the other pillars do not exhibit direct effects. Additionally, a marginally significant interaction between infrastructure and human capital and research suggests that the effect of infrastructure is more pronounced in contexts where human capital is less developed. These findings reinforce the conditional and interdependent nature of innovation inputs and emphasize the importance of complementary investments across NIS pillars. The study contributes to the literature by bridging innovation and complexity frameworks.

This study employs a cross-sectional regression to analyze the factors influencing GII scores in upper-middle-income countries, assessing the impact of sub-indices, pillars, and sub-pillars. The analysis reveals that market sophistication and creative outputs strongly influence GII scores among upper-middle-income countries, contributing significantly to national innovation performance. Additionally, knowledge and technology outputs, human capital and research, and infrastructure pillars show a statistically significant impact at the 5% level. Notably, even minor improvements in innovation output sub-index scores account for substantial variations in GII rankings. These findings suggest that Armenia should prioritize targeted education reforms, increase R&D investment, and strengthen university-industry linkages to enhance its innovation ecosystem and improve its global competitiveness. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Armenia; education; Global Innovation Index; innovation; knowledge-based economy; R&D; upper-middle income country","","","","The research was supported by the Science Committee of the Republic of Armenia within the framework of the project No. 21T-5B234.","Ssrn Electronic Journal, (2011); Knowledge, (2022); Afcha, Sergio, The effectiveness of R&D subsidies in fostering firm innovation: The role of knowledge-sourcing activities, BRQ Business Research Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 302-323, (2020); Ahn, Joon Mo, Do government R&D subsidies stimulate collaboration initiatives in private firms?, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 151, (2020); Apostu, Simona Andreea, Economic Growth through the Lenses of Education, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation, Administrative Sciences, 12, 3, (2022); R D Tax Incentives Evidence on Design Incidence and Impacts, (2016); Bate, Adisu Fanta, The determinants of innovation performance: an income-based cross-country comparative analysis using the Global Innovation Index (GII), Journal of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 12, 1, (2023); Bolzani, Daniela, Technology transfer offices as providers of science and technology entrepreneurship education, Journal of Technology Transfer, 46, 2, pp. 335-365, (2021); Boţoroga, Cosmin Alin, Assessing the Nexus Between Education, Economic Growth, and Innovation: An Empirical Analysis, Studies in Business and Economics, 17, 3, pp. 18-34, (2022); Bozeman, Barry, Tax incentives for R&D: a critical evaluation, Research Policy, 13, 1, pp. 21-31, (1984)","","LLC CPC Business Perspectives","","","","","","17277051; 18105467","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000860647"

According to the NCA model, all variables, except FSI, have the necessary conditions for the energy consumption diversification (ECD). The fsQCA model for high ECD identifies four adequate configurations that involve a combination of high human development, high green growth, global innovation, and either lower levels of urbanization or the presence of fragile states. One notable solution, with a consistency score of 93 %, is that a higher level of global innovation combined with lower levels of urbanization leads to higher ECD. Conversely, the model identifies three configurations sufficient for low ECD, which typically include higher levels of urbanization, fragile states, and lower levels of innovation and green growth. One of the most significant of these, with a consistency score of 81 %, is that increasing urbanization while decreasing green growth and global innovation leads to low ECD. According to the research findings, policymakers should strengthen the innovation ecosystem and focus on developing human capital to enhance energy diversity. Additionally, efforts should be made to combat corruption, stabilize governance, and improve oversight to ensure greater investment in clean energy. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","fsQCA; Global innovation index; Green growth; NCA model; Shannon-wiener index","Green economy; Analysis models; Condition analysis; FsQCA; Global innovation; Global innovation index; Green growths; Innovation index; Necessary condition analyze model; Shannon; Shannon-wiener index; Wiener index; Green development; alternative energy; economic diversification; fuel consumption; growth rate; human development index; index method; innovation; planning method; qualitative analysis; Ireland","","","Funding text 1: Research supported by CeBER, R&D unit funded by national funds through FCT \u2013 Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P., project UIDB/05037/2020.The CeBER R&D unit has been funded by national funds through FCT \u2013 Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P. project UIDB/05037/2020.; Funding text 2: The CeBER R&D unit has been funded by national funds through FCT \u2013 Funda\u00E7\u00E3o para a Ci\u00EAncia e a Tecnologia, I.P., project UIDB/05037/2020.","van de Ven, Dirk Jan, Historical energy price shocks and their changing effects on the economy, Energy Economics, 62, pp. 204-216, (2017); Meckling, Jonas O., Why nations lead or lag in energy transitions, Science, 378, 6615, pp. 31-33, (2022); Liu, Yang, Assessing energy vulnerability and its impact on carbon emissions: A global case, Energy Economics, 119, (2023); Sun, Wei, The impact of energy consumption structure on China's carbon emissions: Taking the Shannon–Wiener index as a new indicator, Energy Reports, 7, pp. 2605-2614, (2021); Li, Jiaman, 3G in China: How green economic growth and green finance promote green energy?, Renewable Energy, 200, pp. 1327-1337, (2022); Udeagha, Maxwell Chukwudi, Investigating the moderating role of economic policy uncertainty in environmental Kuznets curve for South Africa: Evidence from the novel dynamic ARDL simulations approach, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 29, 51, pp. 77199-77237, (2022); Hao, Xiaoli, The marginal and double threshold effects of regional innovation on energy consumption structure: Evidence from resource-based regions in China, Energy Policy, 131, pp. 144-154, (2019); Li, Jingwen, Eco-innovation and energy productivity: New determinants of renewable energy consumption, Journal of Environmental Management, 271, (2020); Sharma, Rajesh, Analyzing the impact of export diversification and technological innovation on renewable energy consumption: Evidences from BRICS nations, Renewable Energy, 178, pp. 1034-1045, (2021); Tully, Stephen R., The human right to access clean energy, Journal of Green Building, 3, 2, pp. 140-148, (2008)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","03605442; 18736785","0080319424; 0080328016; 0080340016; 0080311202; 0080305326; 0080316549; 008032780X; 9780080327808","ENEYD","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208193695"

It presents and describes the characteristics of co-authorship networks of scientific publications among authors from different countries. The published articles were extracted from the Scopus and Web of Science databases, considering a period of 12 years. Following the identification of pivotal countries, the research proceeded to investigate whether their positioning within the network has an impact on their innovation capabilities. To underpin this analysis, data from the Global Innovation Index ranking were employed. Among the six countries demonstrating noteworthy centrality metrics throughout the entire period, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom are also categorized as innovators according to the Global Innovation Index. The overlap observed suggests a relationship between countries maintaining consolidated and resilient innovation networks and positive performance in terms of innovation.

The results of the conducted research suggest that the innovative activity of enterprises directly depends on the quality of the state's development within the limits of innovation and on the quality of methodological, financial, economic, technical and technological support of the sphere of innovations. The article reveals the essence of the innovative activity of enterprises and the innovative development of the economy, as well as identifies their mutual influence and interconnection. It has been found that states with a high level of economic development can provide more convenient prerequisites for the implementation of innovative activities by enterprises and form effective mechanisms for their protection from the challenges and dangers of the external and internal environment. The article identifies significant problems in intensifying the innovation activity of enterprises in Ukraine in the context of war, which are associated with a high level of imperfection of modern technology transfer mechanisms, outdated material and technical base, raw material export specialisation and the advantage of a high level of technological imports. In order to outline the strategic vectors of stimulating the innovation activity of enterprises as a factor in strengthening security of their economy, the main measures to minimise the negative impact of destabilising factors are proposed, in particular, the need to increase the level of professional competence of employees of enterprises in introducing innovations and conducting innovation activities, to increase the volume of financing of the innovation sphere, to reduce the impact of military challenges and dangers, to form preferential programmes for lending innovative activities, and to attract external investors to participate in innovative projects is proved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","business entities; competitiveness; Global Innovation Index; globalisation; innovations; innovative activity; innovative development; the economic security of the enterprise","","","","","Pivdennoukrainskyi Pravnychyi Chasopys, (2022); Butticè, Vincenzo, Counterfeiting in digital technologies: An empirical analysis of the economic performance and innovative activities of affected companies, Research Policy, 49, 5, (2020); Economy and Society, (2023); Theoretical and Methodological Foundations of the Development of the Financial System of Ukraine Based on Innovative Investment Strategies A Collective Monograph, (2020); Visuomens Saugumas Ir Viesoji Tvarka, (2022); Problems of Modern Transformations, (2023); Agroworld, (2023); Peng, Siying, The impact of the digital economy on Chinese enterprise innovation based on intermediation models with financing constraints, Heliyon, 9, 3, (2023); Su, Weihua, Determinants of the innovation efficiency of strategic emerging enterprises: evidence from the robust frontiers, Economic Change and Restructuring, 56, 3, pp. 1433-1465, (2023); Ianioglo, Alina, Innovative component of economic security of enterprises: a case of the Republic of Moldova, Journal of Business Economics and Management, 18, 6, pp. 1228-1242, (2017)","","Fintech Aliance LLC","","","","","","23064994; 23108770","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209146380"

So, for substantial empirical support, the study uses a set of dimensions of inclusive growth separately. The empirical results show a positive relationship between the measures of innovation with inclusive growth.

The analysis identifies 'research and development’, 'online creativity’, and 'knowledge creation' as pivotal factors influencing innovation outcomes. The BBN model demonstrates a predictive accuracy of 90.9%. For high-performing countries, 'information and communication technologies’, 'regulatory environment’, and 'education' are critical, whereas 'investment' shows a low performance in driving innovation excellence. In low-performing countries, 'innovation linkages' and 'research and development' are strongly associated with the low innovation performance of these countries. Sensitivity analysis highlights 'knowledge workers’, 'online creativity’, and 'institutional environment' as significant drivers, illustrating the complex nature of innovation dynamics. This study enhances our understanding of innovation within the GII framework and offers actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders. Existing methods often rely on simplistic linear models that fail to capture the complex interdependencies among innovation indicators.

The results of the empirical study made it possible to find out that during the large-scale aggression of Russia on the territory of Ukraine in 2022, a decrease in the level of innovative economic development was also observed in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. It was established that in 2023, the countries of the analyzed group managed to increase the indicators of innovative activity of business entities and the parameters of the innovative development of the economy. Important problems in ensuring economic progress through innovative activity have been identified: (1) shortcomings of the legislation regulating the innovation sphere; (2) lack of formation of a unified innovation infrastructure; (3) significant tax burden; (4) lack of an effective system of taxation and provision of tax benefits and preferences; (5) lack of effective investment mechanisms in the field of innovation; (6) low level of technological capacity of production facilities; (7) imperfection of the education system; (8) low level of financing of research activities; (9) focus on the export of raw materials and dependence on high-tech imports. In order to ensure sustainable innovative development of the country's economy, it is necessary to create appropriate conditions for the development of innovative potential, activate the creation of cross-border innovation clusters, and strengthen the country's investment attractiveness. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","competitiveness; economic development; economic growth; Global Competitiveness Index; Global Innovation Index; innovations; innovative development","","","","","Vcheni Zapysky Universytetu «krok», (2022); Audretsch, David B., Entrepreneurship and Economic Growth, 9780195183511, pp. 1-236, (2007); Kopytko, Marta I., Financial Stability as a Factor of Ensuring Sustainable Development of Ukraine's Economy in the Conditions of Globalization, (2022); Journal of Interdisciplinary Research, (2023); Economy and Society, (2024); Biznes Inform, (2023); Aka, Kadia Georges, Actor-network theory to understand, track and succeed in a sustainable innovation development process, Journal of Cleaner Production, 225, pp. 524-540, (2019); Hoa, Pham Xuan, Nexus of innovation, foreign direct investment, economic growth and renewable energy: New insights from 60 countries, Energy Reports, 11, pp. 1834-1845, (2024); Ekonomika Ta Derzhava, (2019); Butticè, Vincenzo, Counterfeiting in digital technologies: An empirical analysis of the economic performance and innovative activities of affected companies, Research Policy, 49, 5, (2020)","","Fintech Aliance LLC","","","","","","23064994; 23108770","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201638356"

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs a multi-dimensional innovation-driven clustering methodology to analyze data from the 2019 edition of the Global Innovation Index (GII). Hierarchical and K-means Cluster Analysis techniques are applied using various sets of distance matrices to uncover and analyze distinct innovation patterns. Findings: This study classifies 129 countries into four clusters: Specials, Advanced, Intermediates and Primitives. Each cluster exhibits strengths and weaknesses in terms of innovation performance. Specials excel in the areas of institutions and knowledge commercialization, while the Advanced cluster demonstrates strengths in education and ICT-related services but shows weakness in patent commercialization. Intermediates show strengths in venture-capital and labour productivity but display weaknesses in R&D expenditure and the higher education quality. Primitives exhibit strength in creative activities but suffer from weaknesses in digital skills, education and training. Additionally, the study has identified 35 indicators that have negligible variance contributions across countries. Originality/value: The study contributes to finding the relevant countries’ grouping for the enhancement of communication, integration and learning.

That is why the issue of the main directions of development of the information and technology environment in the Azerbaijani economy is relevant. The research aims to study and summarise aspects of the current state and peculiarities of the development of the digital economy of Azerbaijan. The study used the induction, deduction, analysis, systematisation, SWOT analysis methods. Azerbaijan is a fairly developed industrial and agricultural country, but the country’s economic environment is unstable. The development of the digital economy is negatively affected by a decrease in funding and a decline in the production of high-tech goods. However, the biggest problem is the low level of digital literacy of the population. Accordingly, the main directions for the development of digitalisation of economic processes in Azerbaijan should be measures to expand education in the field of information and computer technologies with the involvement of foreign specialists and introduce mandatory courses to improve the skills of digital specialists. The main factors in the development of Azerbaijan’s digital economy are foreign investment and human capital. Thus, the practical significance of the study is that the main established directions of formation of the digital economy in Azerbaijan can be used in further works of scientists to improve digitalisation in the country, and the established main educational direction can be used by the Azerbaijani authorities to bring the country to the world level following digital technologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital economy; global innovation index; human capital; innovation","","","","","Digital Economy Energy and Sustainability Opportunities and Challenges, (2023); Abdullayev, Kamran, Regulation of the Digital Economy in Modern Conditions of Competitiveness, WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics, 19, pp. 1289-1295, (2022); Abdullayev, Kamran, The Role of Digital Transformation in Building a Competitive Economy: a Case Study of Azerbaijan, Economic Affairs (New Delhi), 68, pp. 705-710, (2023); Abdullayev, Kamran, FACTORS INFLUENCING THE RANKING OF MARITIME TRANSPORT IN THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS REPORT: THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY CASE, Corporate and Business Strategy Review, 3, 2, pp. 43-54, (2022); Abukhader, Sajed M., Eco-efficiency in the era of electronic commerce - should 'Eco-Effectiveness' approach be adopted?, Journal of Cleaner Production, 16, 7, pp. 801-808, (2008); Adner, Ron, Frenemies in platform markets: Heterogeneous profit foci as drivers of compatibility decisions, Management Science, 66, 6, pp. 2432-2451, (2020); Journal of Economic and Social Research, (2009); Emerging Markets, (2021); Administrative Consulting, (2018); Investytsiyi Praktyka Ta Dosvid, (2021)","","ASERS Publishing House","","","","","","20687710","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197469464"

Additionally, to establish the connections between the global innovation mechanisms. Furthermore, a closer look at how factors are distinguished and found to be significant based on a country's level of income. To develop the technique in this quantitative research, we utilized panel data from 105 countries and gathered data from the GII, WIPO, and WDI. In light of this, panel-corrected standard errors with robust regression and panel quantile regression techniques were used to obtain the long-run estimations. There were also two methods used to compare the results: two-stage least squares for robustness endogeneity and augmented mean group for cross-section dependency. This research demonstrates that the method is reliable and suggests that countries are open to expansion in innovation inputs, outputs, and efficiency. It also suggests that countries should record problems associated with how well innovations are implemented. In addition, a proper evaluation must be carried out, which includes the development of innovation strategies that consider the varying economic situations of the countries included in this research.

In this quantitative study, we apply linear discriminant analysis and panel data analysis to the scores of the GII, EPI, and SPI indices for 127 192countries since 2012. Focusing on the results for LAC, our findings highlight the cohesion in innovation among the countries in the region and indicate a positive relationship between innovation and environmental performance. However, conversely, an increase in innovation scores tends to correlate with a reduction in social progress scores.

In the globalising world, countries that renew their product and service range are at the forefront. The way to manage innovation is to measure it. Therefore, to have measurable information, the Global Innovation Index (GII) identifies inputs and outputs that are indicators of innovation. The GII provides a global ranking for countries according to their innovation capacity. In this study, GII scores of 125 countries between the years 2013 and 2020 were estimated using the artificial neural network (ANN). Before the estimation, feature selection was performed from 61 common indicator parameters. 27 parameters that best explain the GII score were selected and used in the ANN.

The study aims to identify the vectors of interaction between the state and potential victims of crime on the Internet by analysing the activities of the subjects of the direction in countries with different scientific and technical potentials. The study employed statistical methods to collect qualitative and quantitative indicators of the issue under consideration, as well as comparative analysis to compare the elements of state policy in the field of combating cybercrime. The intensity of crimes committed with the help of Internet tools is growing every year and it is primarily due to the growth of opportunities to perform various financial, social and other types of interaction in the online space. However, there is a direct correlation between the number of cybercrimes and the level of scientific and technological development of a country. According to the Global Innovation Index, some of the most innovatively developed countries are the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Japan, where the intensity of scientific progress is several times higher than in less developed countries, for example, in the Central Asian region. The role and place of state bodies concerning the prevention of Internet crime is extremely difficult to overestimate because it is the central and local government that has a leading position in the development of preventive measures to prevent and minimise the phenomenon of victimisation of society in the Internet space.

Furthermore, the context of globalisation and market openness requires efficient monitoring and assessment of national innovation systems (NISs) to allow efficient interventions of decision makers. This paper presents a methodological framework for the analysis of a country’s NIS in an international context, and the identification of relevant levers for its improvement. This paper also presents case studies where the proposed framework is applied to analyse three NISs, namely those of Morocco, Turkey and Spain. These NISs are analysed qualitatively and quantitatively with suggestion of improvement levers.

Despite this, geopolitical challenges in recent years pose difficulties for countries, especially for those who struggle with lower GDP per-capita, to enhance innovative performance and grow. Building upon the national innovation system concept and using the methodological framework of country-level composite innovation indexes, this paper aims to explore features of innovation systems inherent in lagging economies and their relevance for economic growth. The analysis, based on a panel dataset comprising the Global Innovation Index elementary indicators on 76 countries during 2015–2021, demonstrates the lower initial state, but faster development of innovation system components in lagging economies. Crucial to their growth is the external validation of national innovation efforts, proxied by international trade and foreign investment indicators. In addition, a sustainable economic growth requires balanced and synergetic development of all components and functions. Therefore, bottom-up approaches are needed to sustain further growth of lagging economies, starting with the provision of effective resource allocation, knowledge creation and its diffusion. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cross-country analysis; economic growth; global innovation index; lagging economies; national innovation system; O11; O36; O47; O57; P51","","","","The article was prepared within the framework of the Basic Research Program of the HSE University.

With it, the paper aims to reduce the level of subjectivity in the construction of composite indicators regarding weight generation and indicator aggregation. The paper relies on PCA as a weighting-aggregation scheme to reproduce the 21 sub-pillars of the GII before the application of DEA to calculate the relative efficiency score for every country. By using the PCA-DEA model, a final ranking is produced for all countries. The random forests (RF) classification is used examine the robustness of the new rank. The comparison between the new rank and that of the GII suggests that the countries positioned at the top or the bottom of the GII rank are less sensitive toward the modification than those in the middle of the GII, the rank of which is not robust against the modification of the construction method. The PCA-DEA model introduced in this paper provides policymakers with an effective tool to monitor the performance of national innovation policies from the perspective of their relative efficiency.

The study analyses a sample of 120 countries using the Global Innovation Index (GII) and its constituent sub-indices and pillars, which provide a holistic evaluation of national innovation. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita measures a country’s economic output, self-employment assesses entrepreneurial activity, and FDI indicates confidence in a country’s economic prospects and innovation trends. This study analyzes the data using generalized-linear and panel-corrected standard-error models. The results show that innovation positively influences GDP, domestic institutional framework, local infrastructure, local knowledge and technology, and creative outputs. In contrast, innovation negatively correlates with domestic self-employment, often associated with necessity-driven entrepreneurship. The study concludes that innovation positively affects human resources, research, and creative outputs and has no significant impact on FDI. The findings suggest that a practical regulatory framework, institutional support, domestic human capital, research and development, infrastructure, technology, and creative outputs are essential for a vibrant economy. National innovation policies supporting the GII and its constituent factors can positively affect the economy while reducing self-employment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","creative outputs; economic growth; entrepreneurship; FDI; foreign direct investment; GDP; Global Innovation Index; globalization; innovation; self-employment","","","","","Acemoglu, Daron, Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth, Handbook of Economic Growth, 1, SUPPL.

The results show that the USA, Germany, the UK, France, and the Netherlands are at the center of the network. International technological cooperation in new energy industry has a significant negative impact on carbon emission intensity. The convening of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen has accelerated global industrial upgrading, and the effect of international technical cooperation in new energy on carbon emission reduction has been strengthened. In addition, the level of economic development, international trade, and research and development (R&D) are also important factors affecting carbon emission intensity. Countries with high network centrality should give full play to their network influence to promote global cooperation in the field of new energy and achieve carbon mitigation targets by signing more environmental agreements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon emission; Energy structure; Global innovation index; International technical cooperation; New energy industry; PCT international patent","carbon emission; energy management; energy market; innovation; international cooperation; regression analysis; research and development; United Nations; France; Germany; United States; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; commercial phenomena; economic development; industry; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Commerce; Economic Development; Industry; International Cooperation; Internationality","","carbon, 7440-44-0; carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide","This work was supported by the [Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province] (Grant number [ZR2021MG018]).","Abid, Nabila, Financial development and green innovation, the ultimate solutions to an environmentally sustainable society: Evidence from leading economies, Journal of Cleaner Production, 369, (2022); Agyemang, Andrew Osei, Impact of board characteristics on environmental disclosures for listed mining companies in China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 17, pp. 21188-21201, (2020); Archontakis, Fragiskos, Patenting abroad: Evidence from OECD countries, Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 116, pp. 62-69, (2017); Arteaga-Molina, Luis A., Empirical likelihood based inference for fixed effects varying coefficient panel data models, Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 196, pp. 144-162, (2018); Ayamba, Emmanuel Caesar, The impact of foreign direct investment on sustainable development in China, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 27, 20, pp. 25625-25637, (2020); Azam, Muhammad Rizwan, A spatial-temporal decomposition of carbon emission intensity: a sectoral level analysis in Pakistan, Environmental Science and Pollution Research, 28, 17, pp. 21381-21395, (2021); Balcilar, Mehmet, On the nexus among carbon dioxide emissions, energy consumption and economic growth in G-7 countries: new insights from the historical decomposition approach, Environment, Development and Sustainability, 22, 8, pp. 8097-8134, (2020); Brauers, Hanna, Liquefied natural gas expansion plans in Germany: The risk of gas lock-in under energy transitions, Energy Research and Social Science, 76, (2021); Cano-Kollmann, Marcelo, Global Innovation Networks – Organizations and People, Journal of International Management, 24, 2, pp. 87-92, (2018); Chen, Zhe, Carbon emissions trading scheme, energy efficiency and rebound effect – Evidence from China's provincial data, Energy Policy, 157, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09441344; 16147499","","ESPLE","36279060","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140463359"

Qualitative research method was used to collect data through semi-structured interviews. A total of 72 interviews were conducted, recording their responses with an average duration of 68 hours. Rational choice theory (RCT) was applied to interpret the findings. It was found that 65% of professional employees were rational in choosing either type of reward before performing their creativities, and the rest rejected it. The reward systems were missing in some of the selected organisations or evasive in others due to some factors: inadequacy of crystal national strategy of creativity’s rewarding systems and the absence of National Creativity’s Key Performance Indicators (NCKPIs). Some employees migrate from one organisation to another for fair reward systems. The study exerts that there is no valuable creativity without reward systems. The study highlights critical recommendations and implications for relevant Saudi governmental agencies and for further research.

Creating policies to stimulate innovation as part of national economic development requires a more in-depth understanding of the current trends, especially the role of science and technology (S&T) clusters. In this study, we use patent and publication data to identify key S&T clusters and leading countries. The lessons learned from their experiences offer valuable guidance for other nations striving for consistent progress in research and development. Research objective. The study aims to assess how well innovation processes are organized in S&T clusters; to identify the factors and drivers influencing the development of these clusters in the global economy; and to determine the competitive advantages of the top countries in terms of patent applications and publication activity. Data and methods. Using the cluster approach employed in the methodology of the Global Innovation Index, we conducted a comparative analysis of the annual data and indicators published in this index related to patent and publication activity. Results. Our analysis has revealed 20 key fields in S&T clusters, the leading positions being occupied by medical, digital, and computer technologies, as well as the pharmaceutical industry. In terms of patent and publication activity, the top countries in the ranking of S&T clusters are the USA, Japan, Germany, and China. Although these countries maintained their leadership in the given period (2017-2021), all of them, except for China, demonstrated a decrease in their share in the indicators under consideration. Conclusions. A country is included in the ranking of the Global Innovation Index of S&T clusters when it exhibits a high quality of fundamental and applied research, as evidenced by its levels of publication and patent activity. To establish successful clusters eligible for ranking, a country should primarily formulate policies aimed at improving the quality of research and development. These policies should also facilitate growth in the key performance indicators, such as the number of patent applications and publication activity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","academic publication; competitiveness; Global Innovation Index; patent; publication activity; ranking; science and technology cluster","","","","","Alieksieiev, Ihor, CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CLUSTERS, Financial and Credit Activity: Problems of Theory and Practice, 6, 47, pp. 77-87, (2022); Scientific Innovation and Industrial Prosperity, (1966); Altenburg, Tilman, How to promote clusters: Policy experiences from Latin America, World Development, 27, 9, pp. 1693-1713, (1999); Innovation and Industry Evolution, (1995); Audretsch, David B., Innovative clusters and the industry life cycle, Review of Industrial Organization, 11, 2, pp. 253-273, (1996); Identifying and Ranking the Worlds Largest Clusters of Inventive Activity, (2017); Introduction to Industrial Organization, (2000); Human and Technological Progress Towards the Socio Economic Paradigm of the Future, (2020); Industrial Organization A Strategic Approach, (2000); Revista De Gestao E Secretariado Management and Administrative Professional Review, (2023)","","Ural Federal University","","","","","","24120731","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174921264"

Innovation process is discussed on the grounds of GII ranking scores accumulated from 2011 to 2021. The research outcome of the Principal Component Analysis adopted nine components that represent seven dimensions. Extracted components are further used in the regression analysis to establish a multiple linear regression (MLR) equation for predicting the GII score used in the overall ranking. Derived regression solution introduced valuable MLR results with high coefficient of determination where 98.2% of the GII values are explained by the extracted components. The dominant effects on GII are attained in innovation components that include general infrastructure and knowledge workers. Moreover, comparison analysis of the actual and computed GII scores illustrated 99.1% overlap between the two values.

To analyze the state and trends of innovative development of the countries of the world, to define the place of Ukraine in the international arena and forecast its innovation. Methodology. The methodological basis was formed by general scientific theoretical methods: generalization, explanation, grouping; statistical method (for a comprehensive assessment of the state and trends of innovative activity of the economies of the countries of the world and Ukraine); methods of analysis and synthesis, economic and mathematical methods of forecasting, methods of abstraction and visualization (for a visual demonstration of the actual data and the results of the study). Findings. The level of innovativeness of the world’s economies and Ukraine’s position in the ranking of the Global Innovation Index (GII) are analyzed. The positive/stimulating influence of globalization processes on the spread of innovations, as well as discriminatory methods of innovative development (“dumping” of second-order technologies in developing countries) are noted. The GII forecast is determined using a regression model of the dependence of this indicator on the specific weight of innovation-active enterprises in the total number of industrial enterprises and innovation costs. The forecasting results showed a slight downward trend in the value of the GII of Ukraine. It is argued that in order to increase the level of innovativeness of the national economy, to strengthen Ukraine’s competitive position, and taking into account the fact that the economies of other countries do not stop in their development, it is necessary to significantly intensify innovative activity in Ukraine. Originality. A scientific-methodical approach to predicting the innovativeness of economic development is proposed depending on the specific weight of innovatively active enterprises in the total number of industrial enterprises and innovation costs. There is an opportunity to carry out predictive and planning calculations of the selected forecasting object, to investigate the behavior of the macroeconomic system in the context of the innovativeness of its development, to make adjustments to the strategic management system at the state level in order to stimulate innovative processes and influence the results of the innovative development of Ukraine in the global dimension. Practical value.

Additionally, the pharmaceutical sector is stronger in some countries than in others. This suggests that the development of the pharmaceutical industry can influence a country's innovation performance. Using the Global Innovation Index (GII) and selected performance measures of the pharmaceutical sector, this study examines how the pharmaceutical sector influences the innovation performance of countries from the European context. The dataset of 27 European countries was analysed using simple, and multiple linear regressions and Pearson’s correlation. The findings show that only three indicators of the pharmaceutical industry – pharmaceutical Research and Development (R&D), pharmaceutical exports, and pharmaceutical employment – explain the innovation performance of a country largely. Pharmaceutical R&D and exports have a significant positive impact on a country's innovation performance, whereas employment in the pharmaceutical industry has a slightly negative impact. Additionally, global innovation performance has been found to positively influence life expectancy.

In this work, quantitative research was carried out on the stress of professors in Venezuela due to the digitalization of their teaching activities caused by the pandemic, and gender gaps were identified in this regard. This digital stress was compared with that of professors in other countries with a low level of digitalization. For this purpose, a questionnaire designed by the authors was used. The questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 129 Venezuelan professors and 132 professors from countries with low digitalization levels. As a result, it was found that Venezuelan professors have lower digital competence and lower digital stress than their colleagues in weakly digitized countries, and that digital stress decreases as digital competence increases. Moreover, among Venezuelan professors, there was a strong gender gap in digital stress, which was higher among females in all subject areas, except for Health Sciences. This gender gap is specific to Venezuela since it differs from that in countries with low digital levels. According to the results, we urgently recommend investing resources in the digital training of faculty members, especially in regards to the integration of female professors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","anxiety; digital learning environments; digital resources; digital stress; Global Innovation Index; Latin America","","","","","Pradhan, Aditya, Supervised Learning Models for the Preliminary Detection of COVID-19 in Patients Using Demographic and Epidemiological Parameters, Information (Switzerland), 13, 7, (2022); Alonso-García, María, Impact of covid-19 on educational sustainability.

Design/methodology/approach: In terms of subindices, pillars and component factors, this research analyzes the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Sweden using the GEI supplemented by the Penalty for Bottleneck (PFB) approach utile for identification of bottlenecks. In addition, the Swedish ecosystem is benchmarked against its Finnish and Norwegian counterparts drawing on data collected between 2015 and 2018. Findings: Using data drawn from the GEI, Sweden manifests a strong entrepreneurial ecosystem with a GEI score of 72.7 out of 100. However, fledgling start-up skills, insufficient human capital, and slow and erratic growth undercut otherwise solid entrepreneurial aspirations drawing on well-developed institutional variables. On a macrolevel, Sweden evinces greater capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation than either Norway or Finland but, on a microlevel, several discontinuities manifest in terms of subindices, pillars and component factors to the advantage of Norway and/or Finland and, conversely, to the detriment of Sweden. Practical implications: Policymakers should fund a mix of programs and institute regulatory reforms designed to promote entrepreneurial systemic development in Sweden by remediating entrepreneurial gaps depressing GEI scores. Crucial policy interventions are required to accrete start-up skills and human capital and engender high growth. Incremental funding of 47% over current levels budgeted to buoy entrepreneurial activity are mandated for Sweden to approach its GEI potential. Originality/value: Insights are derived from extracting data drawn from a new methodology for gauging entrepreneurial activity incorporating individual and institutional variables into a single model that combines PFB and GEI analysis with a view to identifying, through the PFB approach and weak aspects of Sweden's entrepreneurial performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benchmarking; Entrepreneurial performance; Entrepreneurship ecosystem; Finland; GEI; Global innovation index; Norway; Sweden","","","","","Global Entrepreneurship Index Geindex, (2019); Index Building in A System of Interdependent Variables the Penalty for Bottleneck, (2011); Ács, Zoltán J., National Systems of Entrepreneurship: Measurement issues and policy implications, Research Policy, 43, 3, pp. 476-494, (2014); Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index 2014, (2016); Ács, Zoltán J., The lineages of the entrepreneurial ecosystem approach, Small Business Economics, 49, 1, pp. 1-10, (2017); Aghion, Philippe, Entrepreneurship and growth: lessons from an intellectual journey, Small Business Economics, 48, 1, pp. 9-24, (2017); undefined, (2022); Autio, Erkko, Entrepreneurial innovation: The importance of context, Research Policy, 43, 7, pp. 1097-1108, (2014); International Entrepreneurship Review, (2021); Bate, Adisu Fanta, A comparative analysis on the entrepreneurial ecosystem of BRICS club countries: practical emphasis on South Africa, SN Business and Economics, 1, 10, (2021)","","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","26351692; 26351374","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206727548"

However, the research that bridges national innovation systems and sustainability is scant. This study seeks to contribute to bridging this gap by exploring the relationships between national innovation systems and environmental sustainability at the country level. The multiple regression analysis shows that developed national innovation systems can enhance environmental sustainability at the country level, which should be accompanied by a transition towards sustainable consumption behavior and business practices. This study suggests that developing national innovation systems to foster environmental sustainability should encompass systemic changes that nurture and mold the multiple national innovation systems' factors and enable (environmentally) sustainable outputs.

However, further analysis is required to determine how innovation factors affect the technological catch-up process outputs. The main purpose of the present study is therefore to determine the impacts of innovation-building factors (i.e., technological and social capabilities) on the innovation outputs. The role of market and innovation financing in technological catch-up has also been investigated. Partial least squares structural equation modeling has been employed to identify which factors have the most significant effects on this process. We have extracted twelve hypotheses from the catch-up theory and then investigated the effects of the factors on the outputs in seventy countries during 2013–2019. The results illustrate that human capital and research are influential factors regarding technological catch-up in middle (and upper-middle) income countries. Relationships between academic and industrial sectors are essential for educational and research expenditures. Furthermore, business sophistication has a more significant effect on high-income countries rather than middle-income countries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global innovation index; Innovation-building factors; Social capability; Structural equation modeling (SEM); Technological capability; Technological catch-up","Economic analysis; Industrial research; Global innovation; Global innovation index; Innovation index; Innovation-building factor; Middle-income countries; Social capability; Structural equation modeling; Structural equation models; Technological capability; Technological catch-up; Least squares approximations; innovation; numerical model; performance assessment","","","","Theory of Economic Development, (1934); Solow, Robert M., A contribution to the theory of economic growth, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 70, 1, pp. 65-94, (1956); Swan, Trevor W., ECONOMIC GROWTH and CAPITAL ACCUMULATION, Economic Record, 32, 2, pp. 334-361, (1956); A Model of Growth Through Creative Destruction, (1990); Lucas, Robert E., On the mechanics of economic development, Journal of Monetary Economics, 22, 1, pp. 3-42, (1988); Romer, Paul M., Endogenous technological change, Journal of Political Economy, 98, 5, pp. S71-S102, (1990); Journal of Science and Technology Policy, (2019); Freeman, Christopher, The 'national system of innovation' in historical perspective, Cambridge Journal of Economics, 19, 1, pp. 5-24, (1995); Lundvall, Bengt Åke, National innovation systems - Analytical concept and development tool, Industry and Innovation, 14, 1, pp. 95-119, (2007); Srinivas, Smita, Developing countries and innovation: Searching for a new analytical approach, Technology in Society, 30, 2, pp. 129-140, (2008)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","0160791X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123030902"

For Ukraine, whose economy has now taken the form of deindustrialization, the intensification of innovation is a necessary, extremely important condition for its further development. It was previously thought that the socio-economic development and growth of countries depended mainly on their capital and labor resources, while other lesstangible resources, such as information, training, infrastructure development were treated as external factors influencing market behavior only indirectly. However, overtime, the idea that knowledge management is a determining factor in productivity in both modern and traditional economies is becoming increasingly entrenched. The paper proposes results of the research of Ukraine’s positioning in the global innovation space. It also determines the necessity of priority development of the innovative sphere of the country against the backdrop of crisis phenomena and assesses the position of Ukraine in the Indices characterizing the level of development of the innovative component of the competitiveness of the country’s economy. It underlines the insufficient level of innovation infrastructure development in the country. The authors consider that the basis of Ukrainian innovative competitiveness is the development of institutions, infrastructure and business. These areas need special state support, as their effective implementation is the main competitive advantage of Ukraine. The research was conducted according to the Global Innovation Index sub-indices on the horizon of 2013—2021. Econometric methods are used to generalize the positioning of Ukraine in the global innovation space and the DEA method to study the relative individual effectiveness of the innovation environment and innovation activities in Europe. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","competitiveness; digital transformation; digitalization; Global Innovation Index; innovation; innovation potential","","","","","Essays on Economic Topics of Joseph Schumpeter, (1949); Latysheva, Olena V., Management of the sustainable development of machine-building enterprises: a sustainable development space approach, Journal of Enterprise Information Management, 34, 1, pp. 328-342, (2020); El Capital Humano Factor De Innovacion Competitividad Y Crecimiento, (2005); Oslo Manual Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Innovation Data, (2005); Voronenko, Iryna, FOOD SECURITY RISK IN UKRAINE: ASSESSMENT AND FORECAST, Agricultural and Resource Economics, 6, 4, pp. 63-75, (2020); Innovation and Inclusive Development, (2013); Biznes Inform Business Inform, (2019); Skrypnyk, Andriy Vasylovych, Econometric Analysis of the Impact of Climate Change on the Sustainability of Agricultural Production in Ukraine, Inzynieria Ekologiczna, 22, 3, pp. 275-288, (2021); Financial and Credit Activity Problems of Theory and Practice, (2021); Kaminskyi, Andrii B., COVID-19: crisis or new opportunities time for the agricultural sector of Ukraine, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 628, 1, (2021)","","Fintech Aliance LLC","","","","","","23064994; 23108770","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165473242"

Data presenting the innovation potential (Knowledge & technology Global Innovation Index) of selected countries (knowledge creation, impact of knowledge, and knowledge diffusion) was included in the analyzes. Four indicators represented tourism: Business Tourism Spending, Leisure Tourism Spending, Domestic Tourism Spending, Visitor Exports - Foreign spending. The panel regression analysis showed that demonstrable links were proved only for some assumptions, while the identified effects acquired negative trajectories, i.e., in countries where higher tourist spending was identified, lower outputs of innovation activities in the examined areas can be expected. In addition, significant negative links were discovered between the indicators of the creation of knowledge and visitor exports, as well as the dissemination of knowledge and domestic tourism spending.

Purpose of the article: The aim of the report is to assess the level of technological competitiveness of the Ukrainian economy and determine the most important factors for its further development in the conditions of association with the EU. Methods: The article presents the scheme of research of technological competitiveness of Ukraine on the basis of qualitative and economic-statistical analysis, analysis of comparative advantages, cluster and correlation-regression analysis. Findings & Value added: The analysis of world rankings has shown that the technological competitiveness of Ukraine determines comparative factor advantages in coverage of higher education, availability of scientific staff, and quality of research institutions, but low state support, lack of stability, and problems in institutional development hamper the country’s innovative potential. The identification of competitive advantages in trade in high-tech products demonstrates that Ukraine remains an importer of high-tech products; relatively small comparative competitive advantages among the high-tech products of Ukraine has only products of the aerospace industry. Сluster analysis showed that Ukraine is in the same cluster as Poland. Bulgaria and Romania, which have not yet fully consistent with the level of technological competitiveness of EU leaders; among the strengths of Ukraine are the development of human resources and labour effect. The correlation analysis between the components of the Global Innovation Index and the factors of increasing Ukraine’s competitiveness indicates a moderate link between the development of clusters, the ratio of expenditures on R&D to GDP, and the export of ICT services. In order to increase the level of technological competitiveness of Ukraine: to increase both foreign investments and state financing; improvement of regulatory acts, reduction of corruption, institutional improvement; support of technologies through regional cluster programs or “smart specialisation”; integration into the European Research Area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Comparative advantages; EU-27 and Ukraine; Global Innovation Index; High-tech products; Technological competitiveness","","","","7 The paper is supported by the International Economic Relations Department of Artur Golikov, V.N.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute such an investigation by looking at the Republic of Kazakhstan (79th in 2019 GII ranking). Design/methodology/approach: This study looks at eight dynamic variables, among which one dependent (the GII score) and seven independent (R&D spending, innovation grants, the total cost of innovative goods and services, the percentage of innovative organizations, the share of innovative goods and services in gross domestic product (GDP) and the number of R&D staff and R&D institutions) variables associated with innovation performance. Changes in variables were tracked over the period from 2010 to 2018. Findings: The study found that the Kazakhstan’s GII score was reliant on variables, such as the percentage of innovative organizations, the value of innovative goods and services as a share of GDP, R&D spending and the cost of innovative goods and services. At the same time, the number of R&D institutions, innovation grants and number of R&D staff had no substantial impact on the GII score of Kazakhstan. Originality/value: Using the proposed approach, this study proved that factors, which have no direct association with the country’s level of innovative development expressed in GII, could have a significant synergistic impact on this indicator. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global Innovation Index; Innovation development; Innovative goods and services; Multiple regression analysis; R&D; Sustainable development","","","","","Official Web Site, (2020); Aguilar-Barceló, José Gabriel, Challenges in innovation management for Latin America and the Caribbean: An efficiency analysis, CEPAL Review, 2019, 127, pp. 8-26, (2019); Industrial Engineering in the Big Data Era, (2019); Evaluation of the European Union Innovation Policy, (2020); Dotta, Victoria, Trade openness and innovation, Innovation Journal, 24, 2, (2019); Global Innovation Index 2015 Effective Innovation Policies for Development, (2015); Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences, (2016); Fomina, Svetlana Nikolaevna, The effect of teaching and supply chain management on employees' skills in small and medium sized enterprises of Russia, International Journal of Supply Chain Management, 8, 4, pp. 930-938, (2019); Global Innovation Index Reports for the Periods from 2007, (2007); Global Innovation Index Reports for the Periods from 2007 to 2019, (2019)","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","20534620; 20534639","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100313382"

Based on the Global Innovation Index report, we use a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis approach (fsQCA) to determine the configurational differences of high innovation performance between countries with different income levels (high income, upper-middle income and lower-middle income). The results show that a same core configuration of conditions exist between high income and upper-middle income countries. These conditions are a good institutional environment, a high level of human capital research, supporting infrastructure and a mature business environment, which can drive high and upper-middle income countries to achieve high innovation performance. However, in lower-middle income countries, there are three configurations of conditions that are completely different from that of the high income and upper-middle income groups. These results suggest that the policies for improving national innovation levels need to be different for each income group.

It is well known that the current stage of the industrial revolution («Industry 4.0») is fundamentally different from previous ones, as it threatens the massive displacement of mental labor. This paper attempts to assess the impact of technological innovations on employment in the financial sector. Theoretical, statistical, and econometric methods are used in this research. The paper systemizes the various points of view on how the fourth industrial revolution may affect the labor market and attempts to test the validity of existing approaches. An analysis of the relationship between each country's level of technological development (which is measured by the Global innovation index) and the number of employees in the financial sector over the past seven years is conducted. A single-factor model is constructed for each country. Correlation and regression analysis prove the inverse relationship between the indicators in all countries: the higher the level of innovation, the lower the employment level. The results differ among countries only in terms of the strength of the relationship. The strongest relationship is found in South Korea, although the country is lower in the ranking of innovation potential and achievements compared to the United Kingdom. At the same time, South Korea is known as the world leader in terms of the number of robots per capita. However, the obtained results allow to state that there is a strong correlation between the two indicators in both developed countries. In Ukraine, there is a clear downward trend of employment in the financial sector, and the values of the Global innovation index are noticeably smaller and quite volatile. Econometric analysis shows that the relationship is also inverse, as in developed countries, but it is weaker. Therefore, the research results confirm the fears of those economists who extend the negative consequences of technological innovations to developing countries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","employment; financial sector; fourth industrial revolution; global innovation index; unemployment","","","","","Balatsky, E.

To study the regularities and tendencies of the influence of institutional factors on the country's innovative potential in order to determine the ways of its increase on the basis of studying the indicators of ""input""of the level of development of the institutional structure of the country's innovative potential and develop a conceptual model for the effective functioning of the innovation environment. Methodology. In solving the tasks, the following methods were used: Scientific abstraction - in determining the main problems of the development of national innovation systems; critical analysis, generalization, systematization - to evaluate the effectiveness of innovation policy of countries and to compare them; ranking and statistical analysis - to determine the relationship between individual indicators of the global innovation index and the level of development of the country. findings. The ranking of European countries by the main indicators of innovation resources has been carried out in terms of the effectiveness of conducting and using research and development. The ""bottlenecks""which constrain the increase in Ukraine's innovative potential are determined based on the analysis of the ""input""indicators of the institutional structure development level of innovation potential. A high degree of dependence of the country's economic development on its innovative potential is demonstrated. The main directions of increasing the innovative potential of Ukraine on the basis of effective management of innovation resources are formulated. It has been proved that the factors of the environment, namely the political and economic crises, caused by conducting an antiterrorist operation in the east of the country, are not those that inhibit its innovative development. The main directions of increasing the innovative potential of Ukraine on the basis of efficient management of innovation resources are formulated. The conceptual model for the effective functioning of the innovation environment, which is aimed at increasing the intersectoral coordination of its subjects in order to adapt them to the actual conditions of a country's development, is developed. originality. The peculiarities of the formation of the laws of innovation development on the basis of complex comparative analysis of the indicators of the ""input""of the level of development of the institutional structure of the country's innovative potential have been established, which has allowed identifying the factors that are determining in increasing the innovative potential of Ukraine and, on this basis, developing a conceptual model for the effective functioning of the innovation environment.

Design/methodology/approach: Pearson’s correlation was the milestone for understanding innovation indicators at upper-middle income countries profiles. In a MCDA first step, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to obtain the criteria weight. In this step, the judgments or evaluations inputted in AHP were collected from a sample composed by five experts in GII. After getting the criteria weights compose to GII, Borda and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMÉTHÉE) methods were applied to obtain an MCDA-based GII. The inputs for this second step were: the weights come from AHP output; and the countries performance came from GII data. Findings: As a result, it was found out the upper-middle countries’ rank to invest and groups with countries acting like “hubs” or “bridges” for economic sectors in near countries; when they are grouped according to their maximum and minimum scores profiles, observing not only a particular region but also similar profiles at diverse world areas. Originality/value: Pearson-AHP-PROMÉTHÉE works as a supportive decision tool for several and complex investment perspectives from criteria and alternatives analysis regarding innovation indicators for upper-middle income countries.

The simple linear regression - the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model - and correlation analysis - Spearman's rank correlation - was used for statistical processing. The results show that the effect of innovation on the ratio of daily smokers over the age of 15 to the total population may be considered a highly significant relationship. The effect on the annual tobacco consumption per capita is the second most significant relationship, and the effect on the ratio of daily smokers over 15 and under 24 years to the total population is the least significant compared to the previous two cases. Correlation analysis shows similar outputs. All these relationships may be considered negative. It is possible to talk about the lost innovation potential associated with smoking, primarily in the productive part of the population. A higher level of smoking can be associated with a lower level of innovation. Also, innovation negatively affects the tendency to smoke. Therefore, public policies should promote a healthy lifestyle. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consumption; Global Innovation Index; Health; Innovation; OECD; Smokers; Smoking; Tobacco","","","","This research is funded by the RVO 2020 internal grant scheme of the Tomas Bata University in Zlín titled “Economic quantification of marketing processes aimed at increasing value for the patient in the process of construction of system in order to measure and to manage performance in healthcare facilities in the Czech Republic.”","Procedia Technology, (2014); Aksoy, Adem, Determinants of Household Alcohol and Tobacco Expenditures in Turkey, Journal of Family and Economic Issues, 40, 4, pp. 609-622, (2019); Ali, Rahib, Smoking-Cessation Acceptance Via Mobile Health and Quick Response Code Technologies: Empirical Evidence of a Pilot Study from China and Pakistan, Current Psychology, 40, 12, pp. 6085-6097, (2021); Arnson, Yoav, Effects of tobacco smoke on immunity, inflammation and autoimmunity, Journal of Autoimmunity, 34, 3, pp. J258-J265, (2010); Baskerville, Neill Bruce, Effect of a mobile phone intervention on quitting smoking in a young adult population of smokers: Randomized controlled trial study protocol, JMIR Research Protocols, 4, 1, (2015); Berkowitz, Callie M., Prescribing an App?

As a result of the research, the author came to the following conclusions: - If the development of business in the country accelerates the production of innovations, the development of innovations will lead to an increase in digitalization in the country; - The idea that innovation processes are financed only by the state or the state has lost its relevance in the modern economy, and business is also important in the development of an innovative economy; - human capital is an important factor in the development of an innovative economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business; Country digitization rate; Global innovation index; Innovation; USA; “Doing business”","","","","We focus on the development of the digital economy in the U.S., which has shown high positions in all three of these indicators. As we have seen above, innovation policy also affects the digitalization of the economy. U.S. innovation policy includes the following areas: -Development of federal laboratories. These laboratories are funded by ministries and act as research centers; -Innovative activity develops through research and the development of academic education. This direction is carried out by the state and involves students in fundamental research; -US-made technologies are transferred to other countries. This line provides an opportunity for the widespread deployment of U.S.-made technologies. -Specialization of regions in a particular research or production sector; -Development of innovative clusters. This direction plays an important role in attracting investment while ensuring the interdependence of production and research; -Human capital. One of the key principles of modern U.S. development is the development of human capital. This direction is carried out with the support of special educational institutions or individual professionals. -Migration policy. This area includes government support for the entry, residence, and housing of highly qualified personnel with research capacity. Another major driver of the development of the digital economy in the United States is the country's technology parks and large companies engaged in innovative activities. In particular, one of the largest technoparks in the United States, Silicon Valley, will create digital innovations ranging from payment systems to language translators. The world's most famous companies in the field of digital innovation, such as Google, IBM, Facebook, Microsoft, operate in the United States. The most interesting aspect is that most of the financing of innovation production in the United States is done by big business. ZenithOptimedia [8] has compiled a list of the 30 largest media companies. According to him, companies in the top five, such as Google, Walt Disney Company, DirecTV, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, are all based in the United States. According to Forbes, companies such as Google, Intel, and Walt Disney are also in the top ten. [9] According to the Global Innovation Index, government and business spending in the U.S. on IT amounted to $ 511 billion. Companies such as Alphabet and Microsoft accounted for $ 32 billion.

Such instruments provide policymakers with a panoply of relevant information, with which they can stimulate innovation within their territory, thereby increasing national competitiveness. Among the most used innovation indices, the Global Innovation Index (GII) stands out by explicitly distinguishing innovation inputs and outputs, hence, drawing from its input-output framework and extant literature on innovation, we intend to answer the question: Which innovation inputs are more strongly related to innovative outputs? Thus, deriving policy implications aimed at improving Portugal’s innovative readiness. To answer this question, and due to the cross-sectional nature of the GII, we have developed our own panel dataset version composed by 92 countries in the period 2013-2018, which we then analyse through a series of multiple regression techniques, emphasising the results of Eurozone countries and comparing Portugal to them. Results suggest a strong, positive influence of Business Sophistication on innovation outputs in Eurozone countries, derived mainly from the capacity of domestic firms to absorb knowledge. Possible policy implications are derived from this fact, such as, for instance, an encouragement to inward foreign direct investment. However, further research is needed to analyse the differentiated effects of such encouragement, as well as for other surprising results of our study. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","global innovation index; innovation; innovation inputs; innovation outputs; panel data; Portugal","","","","Funding text 1: The authors are grateful to the referees and the editor-in-chief for insightful comments and suggestions.

In Global Innovation Index 2018 which ranks innovations globally, the rating of regional innovation Indonesia has raised two ranks from the previous rank, from 87 to 85. The scores obtained by Indonesia were still above the average of middle and lower income countries. However, at least there are a number of weaknesses in Indonesia from the aspects spread in areas of innovation regulation, for example the environment, school funding by the government, the companies willingness to offer formal training, and scientific and technical articles. The purposes for the assessment of Local Government`s innovation are to provide efforts and strength for Local Governments to stimulate their competitiveness through regional innovation. This activity used regional innovation index calculations by performing calculations based on variables: input, process, output, and outcome`s regional innovation. The location of the assessment is all Local Governments in Indonesia. The results in this study explain that there are seven government service innovations. The result of this assessment activity is the input of regional innovation screening data through online information system. However, there are still some obstacles in the input of regional innovation: the absence of data from local governments in eastern Indonesia.

The degree of involvement in the international innovational market determines the overall level of competition of the country's economy. The main objective of this research is a comparative analysis of the innovative development of the BRICS countries and the characterization of factors providing the leadership of China in it. The methodological basis of the article is the general scientific methods of scientific research: induction and deduction, comparative analysis and synthesis, generalization and realization of results, as well as index method. In the study, the authors have proposed a method for a comparative study of the innovative development of the BRICS countries, based on the calculation of cost-effectiveness indicators for various types of R&D (based on the results of patent activity and publication activity in the period 2006-2018), the determination of the integral index of the cost-effectiveness of R&D in individual member states and its comparisons with the ratings of the Global Competitiveness Index and the Global Innovation Index. Based on the calculations, it was revealed that in China the integrated index of R&D cost effectiveness is the highest among the BRICS member states, which is confirmed by its highest results among the BRICS countries in the Global Competitiveness Index 4.0 2019 and in the Global Innovation Index 2019 and it testifies to high efficiency and prospects for further rapid development of the scientific and technological sphere in China. Based on the analysis of the features of China's innovative development, it is argued that the factors that ensure its leadership in the innovative development of the BRICS countries are the high efficiency of the chosen course of the country's innovative development, expressed in achieving high results with a minimum of resources expended, the availability of affordable and relatively cheap labor resources, and territorial diversification of the country, the presence of experience of innovative development of leading world powers accessible for studying and the formation and implementation of systematic governmental policy of innovative development. Based on the experience of China, the calculation of patent performance indicators and publication activity using the formula for calculating the cost-effectiveness index for research and development allows us to track the dynamics of the innovative development of a particular country based on the rapid development of the national scientific and technological sphere, rather than using innovative service accumulations from other countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BRICS; China; Global Competitiveness Index; Global Innovation Index; Innovation; Integrated Index of Efficiency R&D expenditures","","","","","Russ Foreign Econ J, (2016); Birimkulova, Gulnara U., Perspective directions of multilateral cooperation between the eu and the prc in the context of stabilizing the global financial system, Journal of Advanced Research in Law and Economics, 9, 8, pp. 2551-2561, (2018); Society and Economy, (2016); Huang, Can, Global technology leadership: The case of China, Science and Public Policy, 43, 1, pp. 62-73, (2016); Imamov, Marsel M., Digital threats in the transition of the russian economy to the innovative path of development, Journal of Advanced Research in Law and Economics, 9, 8, pp. 2593-2602, (2018); Kroll, Henning, Regional effects of technological transition in China how relatedness and integration shape provincial development, Asian Journal of Technology Innovation, 28, 1, pp. 138-161, (2020); Comparative Politics, (2016); Paryzkyy, Igor V., State policy of innovative development of national economy: Situation and issues of implementation, Journal of Advanced Research in Law and Economics, 9, 8, pp. 2721-2732, (2018); Paunov, Caroline, Corruption's asymmetric impacts on firm innovation, Journal of Development Economics, 118, pp. 216-231, (2016); Riaz, Muhammad Faraz, Corruption and innovation: Mixed evidences on bidirectional causality, Journal of Applied Economic Sciences, 13, 2, pp. 378-384, (2018)","","ASERS Publishing House No 5, Sabba Stefanescu Street, 200145","","","","","","2068696X","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090606241"

This ranking list enables countries to observe their potential status according to the rankings of other countries. The countries are classified under four groups according to the World Bank Income Group Classification on the GII list. The groups are named as; low income (LI), lower-middle income (LM), upper-middle income (UM) and high income (HI). Also, every country has a score in this ranking list. In this study, the ranking scores of 128 countries are estimated using the artificial neural network (ANN). We chose the relevant 27 features on GII 2016 Report, as input data. The significance of this paper is that; it is the first curve fitting and estimation of the score processes on GII 2016 dataset. The low root mean square error (RMSE) value which is obtained in an experimental study shows that the fitting structure is good enough to determine the approximate score of the countries in GII list. The results also show that the selected 27 features are sufficient for obtaining the income score of the countries. Increasing the number of features would lower the RMSE value and enable better approximation in the curve fitting process.

The scientific novelty consists in applying a systematic, integrated approach to the selection of statistically significant factors that are drivers of innovative development, with the subsequent construction of econometric models and their testing. When developing models, both resources (“input parameters”) and results (“output parameters”) were taken into account, which also allows evaluating the effectiveness of innovative development and developing scenario forecasts taking into account the existing possibilities and limitations, optimizing innovative development strategies. The main methods of research and approaches were used: statistical summary and grouping of information, trend analysis, regression and correlation analysis, testing of statistical hypotheses, factor analysis. The procedure for detecting multicollinearity was performed using the VIF test (Variance Inflation Factor, incremental regression method). In determining the set of explanatory variables (the choice of “short” or “long” regression), the following criteria were used: Akaike criterion and Bayesian Schwarz information criterion. To estimate the parameters of econometric models, the Least Squares Method was used with a preliminary check of the fulfillment of all conditions of the Gauss-Markov theorem. In addition, various tests for checking the constructed models and their parameters for significance, adequacy were applied: Durbin-Watson test, Sved-Eisenhart series method and Breush-Godfrey test, Helvig agreement test, Shapiro-Wilk test, Goldfeld-Quandt test and Spearman's rank correlation test. To determine the influence of explanatory factors on the explained factor, the average elasticity coefficients were calculated on the basis of linear regression as the best model based on the results of all tests. Data and Empirical Analysis: The main components included in the calculation of the Global Innovation Index (GII) were selected for the study. Statistical data on them are published annually, which allows us to estimate the country’s place in international innovation development. The study identified four multiple econometric models: one linear and three nonlinear. The value of the Global Innovation Index was chosen as an explained factor, and the indicators for the main groups in accordance with the GII structure were chosen as explanatory factors. To achieve this goal, the following work was carried out, as reflected in this article: 1) an econometric analysis was performed based on a sample of 30 countries based on the 2018 Global Innovation Index report; 2) multiple regression models were built - linear, polynomial, hyperbolic and power; 3) with the use of special tests, a check for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of random residues was implemented; 4) the parameters and the obtained regressions were estimated for statistical significance and adequacy. According to the results of the study, the model that best approximates the initial data was chosen. Using this regression, one can form scenario forecasts of the country's innovative development, for example, by predicting the values of individual factors using various modern methods of macroeconomic planning and forecasting. The principle is the expediency of the most optimal combination of resources for innovative development in order to ensure the maximum effect on the “output”. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Econometric model; explained factor; explanatory factors; forecasting; Global Innovation Index; innovative development; regression","","","","","Ando, Tomohiro, On the convergence rate of the SCAD-penalized empirical likelihood estimator, Econometrics, 7, 1, (2019); Barnett, William A., Innovations in measurement in economics and econometrics: An overview, Journal of Econometrics, 191, 2, pp. 273-275, (2016); Global Innovation Index 2018 Energizing the World with Innovation, (2018); Introduction to Econometrics, (2007); Innovation and Entrepreneurship, (1985); Economics and Econometrics of Innovation, (2000); undefined, (2011); Economic and Social Changes Facts Trends Forecast, (2015); Scientific Journal Nru Itmo, (2014); undefined, (2017)","","Lifescience Global","","","","","","19297092","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097481197"

The goal was met in three main procedures. Firstly, a cluster of the selected countries was identified, then a relationship analysis was realized on eight variables that determined satisfaction and economic indices (Global Innovation Index-GII, Human Development Index-HDI) and at the end, regression analysis which calculates the impact of innovation activity (GII) on healthcare satisfaction was used (the mean of 8 healthcare satisfaction variables – MeanHC) as well as the impact of this variable on maturity (HDI) in the selected OECD countries (the sample of 33 countries). The cluster was estimated by using the method based on Euclidean distance, and the number of clusters was defined by Silhouette method. Two clusters were computed. Also, the coefficients such as Spearman ρ and Pearson r were used in analysis of this relationship. A significant relationship is not evident only in the variable that determined cost satisfaction. The differences between clusters in the individual satisfaction variables were confirmed by t-test, Welch test and Wilcoxon test. A significant difference between the clusters is in satisfaction with staff friendliness. Regression analysis was computed by means of using a method based on Least Trimmed Squares Robust Regression.

The dynamics and amplitude of the total cumulative innovation index demonstrates a sustainable innovation gap between countries that are in different stages of scientific and technological development. Study of the main components of the GII allows us to determine competitive advantages that need to be improved and problems that require adoption of adequate solutions by all actors of innovation processes. A special role in the search for new sources and development of strategies for innovative development belongs to the state. Recent global developments showed that ensuring the stability of a country's socioeconomic development and raising the population's living standard is not possible without creating conditions for accelerated technological modernization of capital, technology and science thus improving and stimulating innovation. In this regard, taking into account national interests, formation and development of an innovation system is characterized as an important purpose of state management and regulation in the context of globalization. Based on analysis of national ratings compared to global innovation ratings, the authors determined the indicators that have the most impact on the quality and quantity of innovation development in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The authors propose measures of government influence that will improve these indicators. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Global innovation index; Indicators of ranking; Innovation system; Republic of Kazakhstan; State management","","","","","National Interests Priorities and Security, (2009); Technological Systems and Economic Performance the Case of Factory Automation, (1995); Cooke, Philip N., Regional innovation systems: Competitive regulation in the new Europe, Geoforum, 23, 3, pp. 365-382, (1992); Cooke, Philip N., Regional innovation systems: Institutional and organisational dimensions, Research Policy, 26, 4-5, pp. 475-491, (1997); on the State Program of Forming an Electronic Government in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2005 2007; Technological and Organisational Innovations Productivity and Employment, (1992); Systems of Innovation Technologies Institutions and Organizations, (1997); undefined, (1999); Economics of Industrial Innovation, (1997); Technology Policy and Economic Performance Lessons from Japan, (1987)","","Innovation Journal eglor@magma.ca","","","","","","17153816","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066321563"

Public or institutional policies, trying to induce innovation, must be careful to not stifle or interrupt the emergence of novelties in the path from creation and conception to market involvement. Our proposed model argues that innovation emerges wherever evolution, learning, mutation, and competition between individuals and firms are permitted, without restrictions or pre-defined paths to the market. We describe two cases of innovation by way of example: the first case shows how several—and sometimes anonymous—elements interact and compete in a typical environment of innovation, while the second case shows how continuous policies to foment innovation may create results to the contrary. In addition, we show technology clusters as cases where the emergence of innovation can be fostered by policies that observe the complex adaptive system characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cluster; Complex adaptive system; Complex system; Emergence; Global Innovation Index; Innovation; Technology cluster","","","","The authors acknowledge the contributions, discussions, and suggestions given by Enio Padilha and the suggestions and constructive critiques expressed by anonymous reviewers, which helped us in the improvement of this work.

We argue that because creative output requires symbolic knowledge (i.e., negotiation of new meanings), it would benefit from a national context that has not only high-quality basic education but also favorable cultural values (low self-protective values or high self-expansion values). By contrast, knowledge and technology output requires analytic and synthetic knowledge mainly and thus would benefit from high-quality basic education regardless of cultural values. To test these ideas, we performed regression analyses using three archival datasets (the Programme for International Student Assessment [PISA], the Schwartz Value Survey, and the Global Innovation Index) of 32 nations. The results in general supported our predictions such that a high level of self-protective values dampens the positive relationship between quality of basic education and creative output only, but not knowledge and technology output.

In our research, we have identified the main factors influencing the development of information and communication technologies of the country and conducted a comparative analysis of the implementation of these factors in the American and Russian SMEs. As a result of the research it has been determined that in the ICT Development Index, Russia has been holding a stable position since 2017, and the United States is 20 positions up in the list. It has been found that Russia does not effectively implement the policy of intellectual property rights protection. This is evidenced by the registration of many IT companies abroad and the high level of piracy in software, which is 45% higher than in the US and has not changed for 10 years. In our research we observed a positive dynamics in the availability of IT professionals, since 2013 compared to 2018 there has been 100% increase in vacancies. The comparative analysis shows that Russia is able to compete with the USA in Internet service, and it is only 1-2% inferior to US companies. To increase Russia's competitiveness in the ICT, we propose to implement international norms in the domestic legislation, so that we can return many IT companies registered abroad to the Russian jurisdiction. This will increase the country's budget.

It has been investigated that the effective distribution of functions and tasks, their positioning to performers, information exchange, budgeting, and resource distribution are the main stages of effective innovative activities at agro-industrial enterprise. The implementation of innovations at agro-industrial enterprise is often supported by outsourcing. The software Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is presented as a method of control over the process of organizing innovations at agro-industrial enterprise. It is meant to address extensive use of outsourcing, allowing to process large amounts of information during a short period of time, work out conclusions, and develop clear recommendations for optimization of innovations management. The software has been tested at the private enterprise of Ukraine «Granit-Agro» which is oriented at exporting of organic agri-production to EU and Canada. In 2015-2016, administrative expenditures and spendings on managerial grown significantly. That is why, considering the current state of the enterprise and challenges it is facing, we proposed to use BPMN software to improve effectiveness of its activities and management.

The article draws attention to the correlation between innovation capacity and the industrial structure of economies. Its aim is to investigate whether selected groups of European countries show similar trends in industrial structure development reflected in its innovative capacity. For the analysis and evaluation of development in the period 2006–2013, we selected three groups of countries: Benelux, the Visegrad Group and the Baltic Assembly. The innovative capability evaluation, which is represented by the Global Innovation Index, is based partly on an ordinal analysis of its basic indices, but also on the evaluation of gamma-convergence. To assess the evolution of industrial structure, which is divided into five industry groups, the SHA-DE method based on gross added value is applied. The results show the signs of greater dynamics in strengthening innovation when grouping innovation-weaker countries; in terms of the development of disparities in innovative capability, the measured values suggest a divergence of innovatively developed Benelux countries, while in the less developed countries of the Visegrad Group and Baltic Assembly the ranges of disparities are rather stable and tend to weak convergence. In terms of industrial structure, the main differences can be seen among the surveyed groups both in the secondary sector, but particularly in the tertiary ""innovative"" sector. And it is the results obtained in relation to the share and development of the ""innovative"" tertiary sector that confirms the assumption that the innovativeness of a country is largely derived not from the entire economy, but mainly from the specific status of a narrow group of industries that can be largely considered the determinants of innovation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Baltic assembly; Benelux; Global innovation index; Industrial structure; Innovative capability; SHA-DE matrix; Visegrad group","","","","","Agarwal, Rajshree, The legacy of Steven Klepper: Industry evolution, entrepreneurship, and geography, Industrial and Corporate Change, 24, 4, pp. 739-753, (2015); Aubakirova, Gulnar M., Features of innovation activity management in the Republic of Kazakhstan, Engineering Economics, 25, 2, pp. 160-166, (2014); Basic Business Statistics Concepts and Applications, (2019); Borins, Sandford F., Encouraging innovation in the public sector, Journal of Intellectual Capital, 2, 3, pp. 310-319, (2001); Boyle, Gerry E., Simple measures of convergence in per capita GDP: A note on some further international evidence, Applied Economics Letters, 6, 6, pp. 343-347, (1999); Caloffi, Annalisa, What Makes SMEs more Likely to Collaborate?

However, little attention has been given to the effects of corruption and cultural diversity on innovation in cross-country analyses. It is widely accepted that innovation is a major engine of national economic growth, and policy makers and business leaders have recognized the need to create environments that foster innovative activities. This study builds on previous research using the Global Innovation Index (GII, 2009) to empirically explore the impact of corruption and its interactive relationship with economic development, in addition to the effect of three different measures of diversity on country-level innovation. The results of this analysis suggest that corruption significantly harms innovation activities across countries, but the effect is mitigated in wealthier countries.

The factors influencing the competitiveness of countries have not yet been analyzed widely enough in the scientific circles. Thus, we have carried out a detailed elaboration, concretization and generalization of the results of scientific research on the most relevant issues concerning the increase of competitiveness of the country's economy. The purpose of this study is to determine the factors of competitiveness and establish the relationship between factors that improve competitiveness. The main factors contributing to the negative trends of innovation development of Ukraine have been allocated. Further, we have determined the main factors prompting the country's economic competitiveness. A structural and logic relationship model for the increase of the country's economic competitiveness has been formed. Factors that boost economic competitiveness must be considered as a combination of all elements. This will contribute to the increase of economic efficiency of the country's development potential. Factors of competitiveness, which are based on reinforced action of technological progress due to the creation and application of new technologies, knowledge and various innovations in all spheres of life, are subject to constant change and complemented by new factors. Theoretical propositions, identified to determine the factors influencing competitiveness are presented in the study. The structural and logic relationship model between factors, increasing competitiveness is expected to improve the management of the country's economic competitiveness, to secure the increasing level of economic competitiveness, and to be used in the theory and practice of international management. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competitiveness Factors; Economic Competitiveness; Global Competitiveness Index; Global Innovation Index","","","","","Competitive Advantage, (1997); Business Quarterly, (1992); From Adam Smith to Michael Porter Evolution of Competitiveness Theory, (2000); Chang Moon, H., A generalized double diamond approach to the global competitiveness of Korea and Singapore, International Business Review, 7, 2, pp. 135-150, (1998); Zbirnyk Naukovykh Prats the Strategy of Economic Development of Ukraine Collection of Scientific Works, (2014); Competitiveness of the Organization in Conditions of Crisis Economy Marketing Management, (2002); Journal of Institutional Studies, (2009); Competitiveness A General Approach Project, (2005); Competitiveness of National Economy Essence and Conditions of Providing, (2002); Fundamentals of the Theory of Competitiveness, (2007)","","Institute of Society Transformation os@osp.com.ua","","","","","","17286220; 17286239","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84958774340"

The aim of the strategy is to reduce the losses from corruption and drug addiction and increase the profits from socio-economic systems. The global innovations index is analysed and its methodological drawbacks are revealed. The logical probabilistic innovative index is developed (LP-model) and its advantages are described. The development of the innovative technology of risk management in structurally complex systems is analysed. We have developed the hybrid LP-model of the success of solving the innovation problem in which the subjects-events are represented by the state, business, banks, scholars and public opinion. We have also developed the indicative LP-model of the failure risk of the innovations system of the country. We have demonstrated that for the innovations to appear we have to carry out a structural reform of education, science and economy of Russia. It has been proved that it is impossible to solve the difficult socio-economic problems of Russia without the involvement of scholars and public opinion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Country; Economy; Event; GII; Global innovation index; Innovations; Logics; Management; Model; Politics; Probability; Risk; Scenario; System","","","","","Assessment of Complex Financial and Economic Objects Using the Decision Taking Support System Aspid 3w Study Guide, (2004); Proceedings of Kazan University Series 1, (1887); Reliability and Safety of Structurally Complex Systems, (2000); Basics of Constructing the Systems of Automated Refining of Complex Machine Building Facilities, (1982); Risk Management Technologies with Logic and Probabilistic Models, (2012); Risk Management Technologies in Structural Complex Systems, (2013); Solozhentsev, Eugene Dmitrievich, Technologies of logic and probabilistic management of risk of social and economic systems, International Journal of Risk Assessment and Management, 17, 3, pp. 171-187, (2014); Newsletter of Rffr, (2009); Issues of Risk Analysis, (2010); Problem of the Information Support of Innovations and the Science Policy of the State the Future of Russia Challenges and Projects Economics Engineering Innovations, (2009)","","Inderscience Publishers","","","","","","14668297; 17415241","","","","English","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940379599"

For this purpose, the paper follows a method of three main steps. In the first, it organizes GII knowledge issues into a framework of five integrated layers: People's layer, which is concerned with education and research; technical tools' layer, which is associated with the Information and Communication Technology; knowledge-in-business layer, which is related to knowledge workers, innovation linkages, and knowledge absorption; knowledge and technology output layer, which is concerned with knowledge creation, impact and diffusion; and finally creativity output layer, which is associated with creative intangibles, goods and services and online creativity. In the second step it investigates these layers for Saudi Arabia relative to four other countries: Brazil and Russia, which are the first two of the distinguished BRIC countries; and Malaysia and South Korea, which are Asian countries that enjoy distinct development drive. The final step discusses the outcome of the investigations and emphasizes future knowledge development requirements for Saudi Arabia. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Brazil; Global innovation index; Information and communication technology; Knowledge issues; Malaysia; Russia; Saudi arabia; South Korea","","","","Authors extend their appreciations to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh for funding the work through the research group project No. RGP-VPP-208.","Ecosystem of the Knowledge Society, (2009); International Journal of Knowledge Society Research, (2010); International Journal of Knowledge Society Research, (2011); undefined, (2012); Global Innovation Index 2015 Effective Innovation Policies for Development, (2015); Kam the Knowledge Assessment Method, (2012); undefined, (2012); Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data, (2012); Ppp Purchasing Power Parity, (2012)","","eContent Management Pty Ltd info@contemporarynurse.com","","","","","","14479338","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923040889"
